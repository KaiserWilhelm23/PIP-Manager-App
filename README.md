# Verison 3 information

This verison is a massive update. It has updated the UI and many other things, here are the new fetures 

- Dark mode | can be enabled in the 'settings' tab (Defaulted)
- Built-In Console | This console is a live feed of the CMD but simplified for easier reading 
- 'settings' tab | This has two current settings and they are saved in a json file for saved configurations 
- Threading (Developed by Cole Bohanon) | This prevents the freezing of the app and allows for a live feed to the CMD
